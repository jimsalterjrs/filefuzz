# filefuzz flips a certain number of randomly chosen bits in a file, 
# simulating the impact of random small-scale data degradation from eg
# cosmic rays, cable or controller imperfections, etc.
#
# USAGE: filefuzz -i inputfile -b bits -o outputfile [-r]
#
# If bits is greater than or equal to 1, it will be treated as a total
# number of bits to flip in inputfile. If bits is <1, it will be treated
# as a percentage - ie, -b 0.01 will flip 1% of the total bits in inputfile.
#
# Filefuzz will tell you which bits it flipped (by offset address) in its
# report to STDOUT. If -r is specified, it will dump a bits flipped report
# to outputfile.fuzzreport.txt.
